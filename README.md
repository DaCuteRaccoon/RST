Conversion from RST to HTML and Markdown! How awesome is that! Refer to the example below as instructions.
```sh
# Convert to HTML and Markdown, then host HTTP server
bash main.sh

# Just convert to HTML and Markdown
convert

# Just host to HTTP server
http

# By default, it hosts to 0.0.0.0 port 8000, but you can easily change that
```
